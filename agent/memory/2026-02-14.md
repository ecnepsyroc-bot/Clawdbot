# Memory Update — 2026-02-14

## Session Summary

Cory ran a full dev environment audit and consolidation session with Claude Code. The work spanned the entire P16 workstation file system — examining, organizing, merging, cleaning, and restructuring projects across multiple directories.

---

## What Changed

### 1. Dev Environment Consolidated to C:\Dev\

Two dev roots had drifted apart: `C:\Dev\` (the Dejavara monorepo and other projects) and `C:\Users\cory\Dev\` (standalone repos created in an earlier session). Investigation revealed the standalone repos were built from older snapshots — the Dejavara monorepo was ahead on everything.

**Before:**
- `C:\Dev\` — Dejavara monorepo, llm-council, AutoCAD-tools, plus 4 dead/archive folders (21+ GB)
- `C:\Users\cory\Dev\` — standalone cambium, OpenClaw, phteah-pi repos (outdated)
- `C:\Users\cory\Dejavara\` — workstation ops stub with scripts

**After:**
```
C:\Dev\
├── Dejavara/         # Monorepo — Cambium, OpenClaw, Phteah-pi, FileOrganizer, AutoCAD-AHK
├── AutoCAD-tools/    # mOS AutoCAD plugin (now git-tracked)
└── llm-council/      # Multi-LLM deliberation system
```

`C:\Users\cory\Dev\` and `C:\Users\cory\Dejavara\` no longer exist. ~25 GB freed.

### 2. Deleted Directories

| Path | Size | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| `C:\Dev\_archive\` | 21 GB | Dated backups from Jan 29 — cambium-old, llm_council snapshot, etc. |
| `C:\Dev\_SANDBOX\` | 0 | Empty |
| `C:\Dev\Archive\` | 4 MB | Old autocad-command-bridge, superseded by AutoCAD-tools |
| `C:\Dev\cambium\` | 46 KB | Workspace config stub, no code |
| `C:\Users\cory\Dev\cambium\` | — | Standalone repo, superseded by Dejavara Cambium submodule |
| `C:\Users\cory\Dev\OpenClaw\` | — | 1-commit skeleton, superseded by Dejavara OpenClaw submodule |
| `C:\Users\cory\Dev\phteah-pi\` | — | Empty skeleton (0-byte files), superseded by Dejavara Phteah-pi |
| `C:\Users\cory\Dejavara\` | 20 KB | Scripts merged into `C:\Dev\Dejavara\scripts\` before deletion |

### 3. Scripts Merged into Dejavara Monorepo

These workstation ops scripts were copied from `C:\Users\cory\Dejavara\scripts\` into `C:\Dev\Dejavara\scripts\` (which already had 25+ scripts):

- `create-thermal-task.ps1` — Windows scheduled task for thermal monitoring
- `create-tunnel-task.ps1` — Windows scheduled task for tunnel management
- `openclaw-task.xml` — Scheduled task XML for OpenClaw
- `thermal-monitor.ps1` — Temperature monitoring script

Also copied: `docs/NETWORK-AUDIT-2026-02-10.md` → `C:\Dev\Dejavara\docs\`

### 4. AutoCAD-tools Git Initialized

`C:\Dev\AutoCAD-tools\` (mOS AutoCAD plugin, 65 files, 8 MB) had no version control. Now has a git repo with initial commit `74aace7`. `.gitignore` excludes `build_test/`, `logs/`, `*.dll`, `*.pdb`.

### 5. WireGuard Config Cleaned

Found plaintext WireGuard config at `C:\Users\cory\phteah-pi.conf` with private keys. WireGuard was already installed and the tunnel was already imported. Plaintext file deleted.

### 6. C:\ Root Cleaned (Earlier in Session)

Before the dev consolidation, the C:\ root was also cleaned:

- **Deleted:** `C:\OneDriveTemp` (attempted — locked by OneDrive), `C:\Temp\` (EdgeNodeSystem dead predecessor, hashgen, JS fixes), `C:\scripts\` (stale)
- **Relocated to Cambium:** `C:\branches\`, `C:\grafts\`, `C:\docs\` (hexagonal architecture files)
- **Relocated to C:\projects\:** `C:\FO\`, `C:\templates\`, `C:\CambiumData\` → `_Legacy`
- **Operational scripts moved:** tunnel/thermal scripts → Dejavara, `cambium-safe-sync.ps1` → Cambium project
- **C:\tmp\** preserved — active runtime logs from moltbot and openclaw still writing there
- **Credential sanitized:** `cambium-sync-server-projects.ps1` line 24 — hardcoded username/password replaced with `$env:SYNC_USER`/`$env:SYNC_PASS`
- **pgpass.conf** with DB credentials found and deleted from `C:\tmp\`

### 7. Hexagonal Architecture Refactor (on Standalone Cambium — Now Deleted)

A full Luxify → hexagonal architecture terminology refactor was performed on the standalone Cambium repo. This work was ultimately discarded because the Dejavara Cambium submodule was already further ahead — it has a `refactor/hexagonal-ports` branch and modules like Inventory and Jobs already internally restructured to hexagonal (Domain/, Ports/, Adapters/ within each module).

**The refactor DID produce updated documentation** that was applied before deletion. If Cory wants to revisit the terminology cleanup (replacing "Luxify", "ramus", "graft" with standard hexagonal terms in docs), the pattern is documented and was proven to work. The Dejavara Cambium's `refactor/hexagonal-ports` branch is the right place to continue that work.

**Terminology map (for future reference):**
| Old (Luxify) | New (Hexagonal) |
|---|---|
| rami / ramus | module |
| grafts / graft | adapter |
| branches | modules |
| water | port / event |
| sap | port / payload |
| leaves | UI |

### 8. Dead Project Confirmed and Deleted (Earlier)

`C:\Users\cory\Dev\folder_organizer` — confirmed as a dead predecessor of Cambium's staging system. Created Jan 20, Cambium staging built Jan 23. Deleted.

## Current System State

### Development Directories
- **`C:\Dev\Dejavara\`** — Primary monorepo. Git-tracked, pushed to GitHub (`ecnepsyroc-bot/Dejavara`). Contains all projects as submodules.
- **`C:\Dev\AutoCAD-tools\`** — mOS plugin. Git-tracked locally (commit `74aace7`). Not yet pushed to GitHub.
- **`C:\Dev\llm-council\`** — Multi-LLM deliberation system. Git-tracked, pushed to GitHub (`ecnepsyroc-bot/LLM_council`).

### Work Data (Unchanged)
- **`C:\projects\`** — Feature Millwork job folders (30+ active: Netflix, Disney, Dentons, ESDC, Harbourside, etc.)
- **`C:\Server-Mirror\`** — Synced copy of shop server project folders
- **`C:\tmp\`** — Active runtime logs (claude, clawdbot, moltbot, openclaw)

### Infrastructure (Unchanged)
- **`C:\Tools\`** — PowerShell monitoring scripts (LanguageServerMonitor, SystemMonitor)
- WireGuard tunnel `phteah-pi` configured and active
- Installed: Autodesk, Python 3.14, SQL 2025, Java, Cakewalk

### Things Still Pending
- `C:\OneDriveTemp\` still exists (locked by OneDrive process, needs reboot or OneDrive stop to delete)
- `C:\Tools\` scripts could be moved to `C:\Dev\Dejavara\scripts\` in a future session
- The Dejavara Cambium `refactor/hexagonal-ports` branch has the in-progress hexagonal architecture work — Cory may want to continue that
- The new scripts added to `C:\Dev\Dejavara\scripts\` haven't been committed to git yet

## Cory's Mental Model (Confirmed)

- **Dejavara** = the persona AND the P16 workstation. One identity. The master that builds Cambium.
- **Cambium** = the product being built. ERP/shop management for Feature Millwork.
- **Phteah-pi** = Raspberry Pi. Keeps OpenClaw running in a persistent, context-aware state.
- **OpenClaw** = the bot runtime that hosts the Dejavara identity.
- All code lives at `C:\Dev\` (root level, intentional — shorter paths, single-user machine).
